  --CDN:
      CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It's a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographical location, improving website performance and reliability by reducing latency and increasing speed.
  --CrossOrigins: 
      CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls access to resources from different origins (domains) to prevent malicious attacks.
